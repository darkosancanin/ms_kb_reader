### Overview 
Arduino based Microsoft wireless keyboard reader. 
The device passively scans for wireless keyboards in the vicinity of the device, then displays the characters typed on the LCD display. 
Based on code from KeySweeper (http://samy.pl/keysweeper/) by Samy Kamkar. Essentially this is just a subset of that project with a different front end to view the information.
